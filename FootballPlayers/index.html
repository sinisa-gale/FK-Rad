		<dd>STEP 1
	    Create an array of objects, containing at least 5 users. Each of them should have name, age and status. Status should be "inactive" for each of them.

	STEP 2
	    Once page is loaded it should display a popup where user can enter his name. Once it's done name user entered should be compared against existing users.

	    If it doesn't match any user you should console log message: 

	        "User with name " + name + " doesn't exist."

	    If it match some of users, object with that user's data should be copied from array. It's status should be changed to "active", and it should be saved in local storage using "loggedInUser" as a key.

	STEP 3
	    After one minute user's data should be removed from local storage.

	    You should console log a message that user is logged out.</dd>
